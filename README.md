- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @moko12123
- ðŸ‘€  I am studying vortex math and applying it in use to uncover 
- the content of sha256 and sha512 hashes, in order to find a simple 
- method to use with all kinds of hashes, in order to find ascii passwords
-  of lengths greater than 9 characters. , in reduced times of a few minutes
-   with the use of a low power cpu such as a pentium 4. This method does not 
-   use computing power to perform a brute force attack, but through fractal 
-   geometry it can reveal each of the characters used at all levels of a hash.
-    I have been doing it as a hobby for 2 years and my advances can already help 
-    to reveal passwords of 14 characters in length with a gtx 430, in just about 5 mins,
-     without any type of password information, all with the help of mathematics 
-     to find the characters that make up the password. Part of that work is what I share.
-      I dedicate my work and study in my free time in order to find a method so simple
-       that it only takes a few minutes with a pencil and paper to find each character 
-       of a password, or a few minutes with a gtx 430 to reveal a complete file in a 
-       sha256 or sha512 hash.
